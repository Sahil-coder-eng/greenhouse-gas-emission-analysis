# 🌱 Greenhouse Gas Emission Analysis & Predictor

This project analyzes and predicts **greenhouse gas emission factors** using a trained machine learning model. It includes both a **Jupyter Notebook (`Project.ipynb`) for development** and a **Streamlit app (`app.py`) for deployment**.

---


## 📂 Project Contents

- `Project.ipynb`: Main notebook for analysis and model building
- `app.py`: Streamlit app that loads the trained model and scaler to make predictions
- `model.pkl`: Saved trained model
- `scaler.pkl`: Saved StandardScaler for preprocessing
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages

---

## 🧠 Features

- Predicts emission factors from environmental input data
- Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step analysis and model creation
- Streamlit UI for real-time user interaction
- Interactive plots using Plotly
- Easy deployment on Streamlit or run locally

## Steps

- Use path name if the folder
- In cmd use streamlit run app.py
